# ROM Extractor from Mega Man Legacy Collection
Small Python program which have only one function: Extract Megaman(Rockman) ROMs from MMLC .exe

I took the code base from here: https://gist.github.com/VideogameScrapbook/e1dc851234b0bdba97b0c73cf9f52aed, I just added some GUI, nothing else.

# Usage
Just enter the Steam path in the input line, ROMs will be written to the parent directory of program (not MMLC, this program ofc).
